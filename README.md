# DrugHerbicideClassifier
A collection of machine learned models trained to descriminate between commercial herbicides and approved pharmaceuticals

This repository contains the necessary files to run the classifiers described in "Drug Chemical Space as a Guide for New Herbicide Development: A Cheminformatic Analysis".

For readers who are interested in the predictions, but do not wish to run them locally, an online version of this workbook is available at https://share.streamlit.io/butchresearch/drugherbicideclassifierstreamlit/main/main.py.

Installation instructions are included in requirements.txt.

An example calculation is provided in the included the Jupyter notebook.
