# DrugHerbicideClassifier
A collection of machine learned models trained to descriminate between commercial herbicides and approved pharmaceuticals

This repository contains the necessary files to run the classifiers described in "Drug Chemical Space as a Guide for New Herbicide Development: A Cheminformatic Analysis".

For readers who are interested in the predictions, but do not wish to run them locally, an online version of this workbook is available at www.streamlet.com/drugherbicideclassifier.
